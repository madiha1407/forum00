What Does a PPC Management Company Do?

PPC management companies oversee the online paid advertising efforts of their clients. For those unfamiliar with the term, PPC stands for pay-per-click and encompasses a broad range of digital ad formats, from the search ads you see at the top of Google to video ads you see on YouTube.

It’s a PPC company’s job to manage online ad campaigns for different clients, making sure the right ads show to the right people at the right time, within a given budget.

Furthermore, by implementing conversion tracking to attribute phone and web leads to your PPC campaigns, and analyzing data relevant to your goals, PPC management companies can prove marketing ROI.

Every PPC company will approach account management differently. For example, some agencies may specialize in one platform like Google Ads or Facebook, while others manage ads in multiple platforms. Some companies may be more hands-on with account management, while others rely more on a platform’s machine learning to take the lead on changes and optimizations.

In the end, a company’s approach depends on their capabilities and resources, plus the needs of the businesses they serve. Nevertheless, while approaches can vary, all PPC companies provide the same overall service of managing online paid advertising campaigns.
